This Jupyter Notebook (`Covid19.ipynb`) performs exploratory data analysis and visualization on COVID-19 datasets. It utilizes libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and plotly to process and visualize information related to the pandemic.

## Datasets

The notebook uses two datasets:

* `covid.csv`: Contains general information about COVID-19 cases worldwide.
* `covidgrouped.csv`: Provides time-series data of COVID-19 statistics.

## Libraries Used

* **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **matplotlib.pyplot:** For creating static plots.
* **plotly.graph_objs, plotly.io, plotly.express, plotly.offline:** For interactive and dynamic visualizations.

## Analysis

The notebook performs the following analyses:

* Data loading and inspection.
* Data overview using `info()` and `head()`.
* (Further analysis details would be added here as you expand the notebook)

## Visualizations

* Choropleth maps to visualize the spread of COVID-19 over time.

## Setup

To run this notebook, ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib plotly
